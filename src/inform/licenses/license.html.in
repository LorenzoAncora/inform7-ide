Inform is free and runs on Mac OS X, Windows, Linux and Solaris. It uses many different programs, tools, and libraries to do so; these are all copyrighted by different people, and released under several different software licenses. 
<p>
This program, the Inform 7 IDE, is a graphical user interface to the Inform 7 command-line tools.
It was originally designed for the GNOME desktop, but it will work as well on KDE or any other desktop that allows you to install and use the GTK libraries.
It is copyright &copy; 2006&ndash;@COPYRIGHT_YEAR@ Philip Chimento, and is released under the <a href="gpl3.html">GNU General Public License, version 3</a> (GPLv3).
Select Help &rarr; About and then press the Credits button, for a list of contributors.
<p>
Other than portions to which the author and contributors hold the copyright, this program's source code contains portions which are:
<ul>
<li>Copyright &copy; 2007&ndash;2008 The GTK+ Team and subject to the <a href="lgpl.html">GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1</a> (LGPLv2.1);</li>
<li>Copyright &copy; 2004 Tim-Philipp M&uuml;ller and subject to the <a href="gpl.html">GNU General Public License, version 2</a> (GPLv2).</li>
</ul>
Finally, it contains portions derived from the Inform 7 user interface for Windows, which is copyright &copy; 2006&ndash;@COPYRIGHT_YEAR@ David Kinder, and released under the <a href="gpl.html">GPLv2</a>, and the Inform 7 user interface for Mac OS X, which is copyright &copy; 2006&ndash;@COPYRIGHT_YEAR@ Andrew Hunter and Toby Nelson, and also released under the <a href="gpl.html">GPLv2</a>.
<p>
Some of the underlying command-line tools are open source software, and some are not. The Inform 7, or Natural Inform, compiler is copyright &copy; 2005&ndash;@COPYRIGHT_YEAR@ Graham Nelson and distributed under the traditional <a href="inform.html">Inform license</a>: it is free, and imposes no significant restrictions on even commercial use, but is not yet open source in the sense of the GPL (even though source code is likely to be published in due course): in particular, those wishing to develop variant forms must apply for copyright permission.
<p>
The open-source tools are Inform 6, cBlorb, and Inweb.
They are copyright &copy; 1993&ndash;@COPYRIGHT_YEAR@ Graham Nelson, and their source code is distributed verbatim along with this program's source code.
Inweb is only used for compiling cBlorb and is therefore not included in binary distributions of the Inform IDE.
Inweb and cBlorb are released under the <a href="artistic.html">Artistic License 2.0</a>, whereas the Inform 6 compiler is published under the original <a href="inform.html">Inform license</a>, or under the <a href="artistic.html">Artistic License 2.0</a>, at the user's choice.
<p>
Several auxiliary programs are used in the Inform IDE, for interpreting story files or other purposes.
Their source code is distributed in a modified form along with this program's source code.
One of these is Frotz, which is copyright &copy; Stefan Jokisch, and released under the <a href="gpl.html">GPLv2</a>.
<p>
Another is Glulxe, which is copyright &copy; 1999 Andrew Plotkin. For more information on Glulxe, go to <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/glulx/index.html">http://www.eblong.com/zarf/glulx/index.html</a>.
<p>
The third and final one is Git, which is copyright &copy; 2003 Iain Merrick, and released under an <a href="git.html">MIT License</a>.
<p>
The program used to display these interpreters in the main application is the Chimara Glk library, which is copyright &copy; 2008&ndash;@COPYRIGHT_YEAR@ Philip Chimento and Marijn van Vliet, and released under a <a href="chimara.html">BSD License</a>.
<p>
Chimara's source code contains documentation belonging to the Glk specification which is copyright &copy; 1998&ndash;2004 Andrew Plotkin. For more information, go to <a href="http://www.eblong.com/zarf/glk/index.html">http://www.eblong.com/zarf/glk/index.html</a>.
<p>
Also included in the source code of this program is the Ratify library, which is copyright &copy; 2009&ndash;@COPYRIGHT_YEAR@ Philip Chimento, and released under the <a href="lgpl3.html">GNU Lesser General Public License, version 3</a> (LGPLv3).
