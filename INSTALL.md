# Installation instructions

The easiest way to install the app is to get it on [Flathub][1].
You can also find DEB and RPM packages in [Inform's release notes][2].

[1]: https://flathub.org/apps/com.inform7.IDE
[2]: https://github.com/ganelson/inform/releases/tag/v10.1.2

After installing it, you'll find it in the apps grid or menu or wherever
else you start your apps from.

## Notes

* If you have installed a pre-release package, you may need to first
  remove it entirely before you install an official release.

* If you need to try the latest and greatest features, or you want to
  help develop the app, see [the build instructions](./BUILD.md) to
  build your own copy from the source code.
