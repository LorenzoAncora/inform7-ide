  <description>
    <p>
      Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural
      language, a new medium of writing which came out of the "text adventure"
      games of the 1980s.
      It has been used by many leading writers of IF over the last twenty
      years, for projects ranging from historical reconstructions, through
      games, to art pieces, which have won numerous awards and competitions.

    <p>
      Inform's educational users span a uniquely wide age range, from primary
      schools to graduate computer science classes.
      Although Inform has also been used for commercial commissions, in
      architecture, in the games industry and in advertising (most recently
      for a major 2014 product launch), its primary aim is to help and to
      encourage individual writers to express themselves in a new medium.
      In a single evening with Inform, it's possible to write a vignette and
      publish it as an interactive website, playable on any browser.
