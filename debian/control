Description: Inform 7 interactive fiction programming environment
 Inform is a design system for interactive fiction based on natural
 language, a new medium of writing which came out of the "text adventure"
 games of the 1980s.
 It has been used by many leading writers of IF over the last twenty
 years, for projects ranging from historical reconstructions, through
 games, to art pieces, which have won numerous awards and competitions.
